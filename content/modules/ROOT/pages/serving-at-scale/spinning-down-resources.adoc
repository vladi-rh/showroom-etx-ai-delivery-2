# Lab: Spinning Down Resources

In this section we will spin down some of the vLLM instances we have deployed, and bring down the GPU nodes to help save on the costs of the lab.

During other sections of the lab you will bring back up the GPU nodes and the vLLM instances as needed.

== Spinning Down the vLLM Instances

As of OpenShift AI 2.22.1, we do not have the ability to scale down a Model server from the OpenShift AI Dashboard.  However, we can spin down the model server by adding an annotation to the InferenceService object.

OpenShift AI 2.23 adds an option the the OpenShift AI Dashboard to scale down a Model server from the UI.

. Run the following commands to add the annotation to the InferenceService objects to stop the model servers.

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc annotate inferenceservice granite-8b "serving.kserve.io/stop"="true" --overwrite -n vllm
oc annotate inferenceservice granite-guardian "serving.kserve.io/stop"="true" --overwrite -n vllm
oc annotate inferenceservice vllm-multi-node-llama "serving.kserve.io/stop"="true" --overwrite -n vllm
----

. Verify the model servers successfully stop:

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get pods -n vllm
----

You can spin a model server back up by setting the annotation value back to `false`:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc annotate inferenceservice granite-8b "serving.kserve.io/stop"="false" --overwrite -n vllm
----

== Spinning Down the GPU Nodes

Now that our model servers are stopped, we can spin down the GPU nodes.

. Open the OpenShift Web Console and navigate to the `Compute` > `MachineSets` page.

+
image::serving-at-scale/machinesets.png[MachineSets]

. You should see three `g6.12xlarge` MachineSets.  The first two should show `1 of 1 machine` and the third should show `0 of 0 machines`.  Select the first MachineSet by clicking on the name of the MachineSet.

. Click `1 machine` under the `Desired count` section and update the value to `0` the click `Save`.

[TIP]
====
There is bug in the OpenShift Web Console that ships with OpenShift 4.18.6 that prevents you from clicking the `-` button to decrease the `Desired count` section to 0.  You can simply delete the number and type in `0` instead.
====

. Repeat the process for the second MachineSet.

. To verify the MachineSets have been scaled down, you can check the nodes in the cluster with the following command:

+
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
watch oc get nodes
----

+
You should see the two GPU nodes with the role `worker,worker-gpu` have the update their status to `Ready,SchedulingDisabled`, then `NotReady,SchedulingDisabled`, and finally they will be removed from the nodes list.

+
[source,bash]

Every 2.0s: oc get nodes

To spin the GPU nodes back up, you can update the `Desired count` section back to `1` and click `Save` for the MachineSets.

== Conclusion

Congratulations you have successfully spun down the our vLLM instances and the GPU nodes.
